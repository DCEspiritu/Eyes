# Eyes Exercise
## Description of the project:
This project demonstrates how to use HTML, CSS and Javascript together by creating a web page where two eyes follow your mouse curser. 

## How to Run:
Download the files making sure they are in the same folder, they have the same file names and open index.html within a browser. Move your mouse curser around the browser window and watch as the eyes follow it around.

## Roadmap of future improvements:
Future improvements would be to add more art to the page and/or even more eyes. I would add an image in the background to make it seem like the eyes are on a creature or animal or person. Also changing the image of the eyes to be more realistic.
